## Abstract
### There are several applications that use the flow mechanics with swirl, some examples in engineering are the optimization of burning in combustion chambers, cyclonic separators, intensifiers for heat exchange and turbomachine. Axial inlet cyclonic separators are required in the production of oil and gas due to their in-line disposition and compact design. The phenomena present in the swirling flow of an axial hydrocyclone is the object of study of this master's thesis with the objective of identify and reduce adverse phenomena for liquid-gas separation. An approach via CFD was used using commercial software Ansys Fluent. The computational domain is two-dimensional and discretized by a quadrilateral mesh with a constant section. Laminar and turbulent studies were carried out to validate the model used, both single-phase and isothermal. The fields of axial velocity and tangential velocity, pressure field, intensity and swirl decay were explored. Another object of study was the addition of an aerodynamic tail downstream of the separator as a way to mitigate the adverse effects of the flow. Drag coefficient, shear stress and pressure pressure were explored numerically in the tail, in addition to the pressure drop induced in the flow. The third study carried out was the dynamics of a particle of gas dispersed in a continuous phase of liquid, varying the diameter of the particles. The results obtained reached the expectation of validation of the adopted model and presented fundamental results for the continuity of the study.
